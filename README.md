# Book'd Up
A web app that allows a user to create and sort bookshelves, as well as create and join bookclubs.

Front end is developed using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) (initialized using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)). HTTP requests to APIs are achieved using [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).
<br>
Back end is built using [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) which communicates with a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.
<br><br>
[Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books) is used to retrieve book information and covers.
<br><br>
MatchBookðŸ”¥ is a Tinder-like feature for books, where the user is presented with books one by one to skip/save depending on the genre they choose. The 3D book view is created with [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber). A [cors-anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere) proxy runs alongside the Express server to allow using book cover images from Google Books API. The [color-thief-react](https://github.com/jonyw4/color-thief-react) library is used to obtain the book cover's dominant color to color the 3D book's back cover and spine.
